NoobNote
-by NoobScience 2021
NoobNote is a beginner friendly project for python.
You have to have python  installed to use NoobNote
It is a almost perfect clone of Notepad. 
It is Registered under the MIT Lisence.
Feel free to use it however you like.

NoobNote is not compiled. You may compile it with easily with pyinstaller maually in the terminal or run compile.bat or compile.sh to compile with pyinstaller.
NoobNote is not compiled because it is not yet a fully develloped app. It is just my fun take on how Notepad should be. If you encounter any errors, run the trobuleshoot.py to check or the error or any missing modules
NoobNote_explained.py has comments on the internal working of NoobNote. This will be useful for begginers as well as to trobuleshoot any problems you have.
Run NoobNote.py for normal use
Run NoobNote.pyw for use withour terminal
NoobNote.py can be usefull for trobuleshooting
