Things That Could Go Wrong:
NoobNote is a fairly New Project and it is quite difficult to implement some of the features implemented in it, hence there can be chance for error, below is the list of know bugs and I will fix them as soon as possible, keep checking the https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/NoobNote/releases for newer updates with bug fixes. There are no known errors for v.1.1, So if you are looking for a light and stable experince, download v.1.1 versions of LiteNote and DevNote. However if you do encounter any issue while using NoobNote, please report them at https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/NoobNote/issues

1. If You are using python versions of NoobNote, You don't need any extra third party modules to run it, but if you want to use the Qr-Code generator, you should have pyqrcode installed. You can install it by pip install pyqrcode.
2. NoobNote is very light weight and should barely take up 14mb ram and barely any cpu, but when you use the !cmd command to execute commands or run a file, NoobNote may seem unresponsive, this shall be fixed once you quit the application that NoobNote ran or opened. For Example, if you ran a python file fron run option, NoobNote shall be unresponsive but once you close python interperter, it shall be fixed.
3. Buttons might not work sometimes, if they don't press them twice properly and they should.
4. If Any of the Files mentioned in Files included in Standard installtion(see above) are missing, it may lead to various errors, so be sure to check all the files once you download NoobNote and if any of them are missing, manually copy them from the https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/NoobNote/ repository and report it as in issue at https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/NoobNote/issues

Author:
I wrote NoobNote to learn tkinterand python. I also wanted to have a good alternative to Notepad, but not Notepad++. Hence NoobNote, it is as light weight, fast and as simple as Notepad, but at the same time, a bit more feature rich, private and secure. NoobNote took a considerable amount of time and effort to make so, if you want to contribute, be sure to check out CONTRIBUTE.md
